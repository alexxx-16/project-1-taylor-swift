          <pre>
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say
The less I know
Wherever you stray
I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say
The less I know
Wherever you stray
I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man

You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
But I come back stronger than a 90's trend

Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
Guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait and switch was a work of art

The more that you say
The less I know
Wherever you stray
I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man

You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man

The more that you say
The less I know
Wherever you stray
I follow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man

You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man

Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait and switch was a work of art

That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans
That's my man</pre

            It is fitting that the opening track to folklore’s sister album,
            where we wade further into the forest that is Taylor Swift’s
            imagination and storytelling, would center on the type of tree that
            is a symbol of hope, belonging, safety, stability, and healing.
            “willow,” one of the few more obviously autobiographical tracks on
            the album, is a hymn of gratitude for her man (as she wants you to
            know, yes, thirteen times), Joe Alwyn, and how the invisible string
            tethering them together pulled her to him in a time when everyone
            else was counting her out. Though not as present on many of the
            other songs later to come on this record, you can feel the lightness
            in her heart on this song as she embraces the way in which the
            willow has bent, wrecking her plans, throwing her into the water and
            leaving her happily lost and afloat in his current. The downward key
            modulation throughout the last two repetitions of the chorus is
            beautiful and very fitting for Swift vocally, but also sounds like
            the feeling of finding your comfort and settling into it, basking it
            in while you wait for the next place the wind pulls you. Best lyric:
            “Now this is an open/shut case / I guess I should’ve known from the
            look on your face / Every bait and switch was a work of art.”
