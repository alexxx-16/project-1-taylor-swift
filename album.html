              It is fitting that the opening track to folklore’s sister album,
              where we wade further into the forest that is Taylor Swift’s
              imagination and storytelling, would center on the type of tree
              that is a symbol of hope, belonging, safety, stability, and
              healing.

              On the second track of the album, Taylor dives back into the
              fictional worldbuilding she began to explore on folklore. While on
              folklore high school relationships and dramatics took
              center-stage, evermore graduates from adolescence to young
              adulthood, not that it is any easier emotionally on the listener’s
              heart.

            <h2>gold rush</h2>
            <p>
              Taylor explained that this song “takes place inside a single
              daydream where you get lost in thought for a minute and then snap
              out of it.” The daydream consists of a love story so pure that the
              town had never seen such a thing; it could only happen in a
              fantasy for the narrator.

            <h2>'tis the damn season</h2>
            <p>
              According to Aaron Dessner, Taylor had written the lyrics for
              “’tis the damn season” in the middle of the night amidst their
              Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions recording after a long
              night of chatting and drinking with their co-conspirator, Jack
              Antonoff. The lyrics perfectly encapsulate the guttural ache the
              track evokes.

            <h2>tolerate it</h2>
            <p>
              Inspired by the novel Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier, “tolerate it”
              is an agonizing track from the perspective of a devoted wife who
              polishes plates and paints portraits and waits by the door for her
              husband with a battle hero’s welcome, who at best tolerates all
              her adoration. There are few things as painful as idolization
              being met with indifference, when you have all this love to give
              to someone who just leaves it there untouched.

            <p>
              “no body, no crime,” the one evermore song solo-written by Taylor,
              has the clearest plot from beginning to end. In the same vein as
              the female powerhouse country classic “Goodbye Earl” by The
              Chicks, Taylor is out for blood to avenge her friend, Este (named
              for one of the HAIM sisters). The story goes as such: Este’s
              husband kills her for calling him out on his infidelity, and then
              Taylor kills the husband and frames his mistress.

            <h2>happiness</h2>
            <p>
              Written a week before the album’s release, “happiness” is one of
              Swift’s strongest and most reflective breakup songs. Although she
              writes it as though it is recent, there’s a lot of power in
              knowing that she’s been happily in love for four years, and that
              she is even better now at doing the thing that has always been
              best at. She is finally “above the trees,” as she sings, and is
              able to see it all for what it is, but her character is still in
              the heat of it all, trying to navigate the stages of grief when a
              relationship ends.

            <h2>dorothea</h2>
            <p>
              Taylor Swift has the uncanny ability to create such developed and
              well-rounded characters with such little information, which is
              what makes her storytelling so compelling. In “dorothea,” we learn
              much about the title character through the narrator’s eyes, and
              the relationship they once had. The lyric “skipping the prom just
              to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes” alone tells an
              entire story in itself.

            <h2>coney island (feat. The National)</h2>
            <p>
              What really started the folklore / evermore journey was Taylor’s
              love for The National. Taylor has cited them as one of her
              favorite bands for many years, and as we know, this led to her
              beautiful new collaborative relationship with Aaron Dessner. So it
              would make sense for the track written with the intention of this
              duet to be so well executed; you can feel the love and care Taylor
              put into writing this song.
